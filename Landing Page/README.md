## About

This is a dynamic website where if click on any of the section buttons it would scroll you down to the selected section, highlighted sections would show as active. Once scrolling to section one a go to top button would appear to help you scroll back to top. After not scrolling for 8 seconds the navigation bar with the buttons will disappear, if you would like to get the navigation bar again you can scroll in any direction and the bar would reappear.
The webpage is also a dynamic webpage meaning that whenever you add a new HTML section, the navigation button for it will appear with full functionality.

### Implementation

This website uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
The JavaScript in this website is mainly to add the navigation buttons and to add the go to top button.  
It is also used to create the functionality of all the buttons.  
Click event listeners were used to define the functionality of the buttons when clicked.  
The scroll event listeners were used to show the go to top button and to hide the navigation bar.  
The set time out method was used to set when the navigation bar would disappear.
